                    <li>
                        JSX:It is a simply syntactic sugar for creating very specific JavaScript objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Component:Components are independent and reusable bits of code.Their purpose is same of a function.But they work in isolation and return a HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Props:It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events:An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or system generated event.

                    <li>
                        State:The State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        useEffect:useEffect is a function that gets executed for 3 different React component lifecycles.Those lifecycles are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount lifecycles.useEffect accepts a function as itâ€™s first argument. This function handler will take care of any side effects you like when it gets run.
                    </li>
